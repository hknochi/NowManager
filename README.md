Timestamp and tally counter for Android
Now Manager


Why I’m Open-Sourcing This App
I don’t have enough experience to work with the in-depth features that this project requires. I got it off the ground, but it’s missing a lot of key components to make it appeal to a larger audience. It started off as a small project on my own, but I want it to evolve into something more. I’ve developed several Android applications in the past on my own, but I want to gain more experience with these challenging areas of development listed below. I’m very eager to learn and work with others on development efforts.

Features to add:
•  Logs are currently not saved onDestroy - huge issue I can’t figure out
•  Drag and drop rows via long press
•  Contextual action bar with options to share/change background/set reminder
•  Widget with data from the app
•  Geolocation logging via Maps API
•  Preferences: time and date formats
•  Grouping logs in folders

Goal:
I want Now Manager to be a quick and easy way to log events that happen and share them with your friends. Not only this, but I would like to see more analytics involved in keeping track of events and progress with various uses.
